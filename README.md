# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a beginner-friendly Python game where the player tries to guess a number randomly selected by the computer between 1 and 10.

## 👨‍💻 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - "Too low" if the guess is less than the number.
  - "Too high" if the guess is more than the number.
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
- It also displays the number of attempts taken.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system. Then run:

```bash
python guess_game.py
